# Ad Hoc Utility

Since iOS and Android promo codes are a hassle to figure out (in terms of delivering the codes to people),

- Add the emails and promo codes in Google Sheet
- Configure env for this script
    - Mailjet credentials
    - Google credentials
- Hit `python send.py` and you're good to go.
